        <h2>Reflection on Gender Roles and Relationships</h2>
        <blockquote>
          "Abel wanted a traditional marriage with a traditional wife… but he
          never fell in love with subservient women… 'He only wants a woman who
          is free because his dream is to put her in a cage.'"
        </blockquote>

            <p>
              This quote made me pause. It speaks to a kind of love that isn’t
              really love at all, the kind that admires someone’s freedom, only
              to later try to take it away. I’ve seen this pattern in the world
              around me: people drawn to strong personalities, but uncomfortable
              when that strength shows up in ways they can’t control. Abel’s
              desire for a “traditional” wife was really about wanting
              dominance, not connection. And Patricia, who refused to be small,
              paid the price for being free.
            </p>

            <p>
              What struck me is how relevant this still is. Even today, people
              praise “independent women” but expect them to shrink once they’re
              in a relationship. Being soft-spoken is expected, being assertive
              is often labeled as aggressive. There’s still a quiet pressure to
              make yourself more palatable. That’s why Patricia stands out, she
              refused to change who she was to make Abel feel more powerful. Her
              strength wasn’t loud or performative, it was steady. She raised
              Trevor to think for himself, to see beyond systems designed to
              make him feel less. And that made her dangerous in the eyes of a
              man who needed control to feel whole.
            </p>

            <p>
              This quote resonates with ongoing conversations about gender roles
              in modern relationships. Many people still idealize the past,
              wanting the benefits of contemporary equality while craving
              control rooted in patriarchy. Abel is not unique, his mindset
              reflects how society romanticizes domination under the guise of
              protection or structure. In today’s world, freedom and equality in
              relationships must coexist with vulnerability and mutual respect.
              Women should not have to surrender their autonomy to be loved
              fully. True love doesn’t fear freedom; it makes room for it.
              Patricia understood that. Abel never did.

                The Rebel’s Colorblind Son
              </h2>
              <p>
                If I were to reimagine the title of this book, it would be: <em>The Rebel’s Colorblind Son</em>. This reflects the core of Trevor
                Noah’s story, a boy born into a divided world, taught to see
                beyond its lines by a fiercely independent mother. Patricia's
                rebellion against the system shaped Trevor’s values, humor, and
                identity. This title honors their bond and the way he inherited
                her fighting spirit in a society obsessed with labels.
